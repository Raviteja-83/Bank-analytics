# Bank-analytics
This project analyzes customer financial transactions and loan portfolios to understand bank performance, customer behavior, and risk patterns. The dataset includes credit transactions, debit transactions, and loan details such as disbursement amount, term, interest, maturity, and customer demographics.

EXCEL KEY FEATURES

The data shows two major things about bank's performance: your money flow is stable but customer activity is very low.
1. Extremely Balanced Money Flow bank's total Credits (money coming in) and Debits (money going out) are almost perfectly equal.
2. Total Credit Amount:127.60M
3. Total Debit Amount: 127.29
4. Credit to Debit Ratio: 1.0025
5. What this means: For every 1.00M that leaves the bank, 1.0025M comes in. This is a very small difference. accounts are near parity, which indicates financial stability in terms of overall cash flow, but doesn't tell you where the money is moving.
6. 2. Low Customer Activity (The Big Problem)
   3.   customers are not using their accounts much, which is a major concern for growth and engagement
   4.   .Number of Customers: 100,000
   5.    Number of Transactions (Credit + Debit): 100,000
   6.What this means: On average, I have only 1 transaction per customer for the entire period i analyzed. This suggests:Accounts are Dormant: A large number of  customers are inactive or barely using their bank accounts.
     3. Hardly Any Active Users
     4. The specialized "Account Activity Ratio" confirms that very few customers are frequent users.
     5. Account Activity Ratio: 1: 0.00019
     6. What this means: If this ratio measures highly active customers versus  total customer base, it implies that out of $\mathbf{100,000}$ customers, only about 19 customers are considered highly active. The vast majority of  business volume comes from a tiny fraction of  users.
     7. Actionable Summary
     8. The bank's ledger is healthy and balanced, but its operational performance is weak. i have 100,000 customers who are essentially non-users.  primary business objective should be to increase customer engagement and transaction volume to move accounts from "dormant" to "active."
